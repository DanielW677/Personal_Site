  <h2>Basketball Player</h2>
  <p class="BasketballP">My favorite thing to do is to stay active. The best way to do this is to play basketball. Basketball keeps me healthy esecially when most of my day revolves in sitting in my chair. This sport also helps to sharpen my decison making skills. This is beacuse basketball is a very fast paced game and requires quick moves. </p>
  
  <h2 class="gamerH">My coding journy</h2>  
  <p class="gamerP">My first time coding was in 2018, I took a web development course in my freshman year of high school. Around this time is when we were hit by the pandemic so I moved to an online school. At this school coding was not an offered class so I put codding off for years. Until 2022 this is when I really started trying to learn to code. I first started doing self taught and learned quite a bit. This wasn't enough so I joined my first coding bootcamp, FullStack Academy.</p>
